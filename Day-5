Diffrence between Window and Document Object in javascript:

The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. 
It is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM);
 A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
