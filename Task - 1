1.Write a blog on difference between http1.1 vs http2:

      HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,
it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
      HTTP 2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at 
at once so that no one resouce blocks any other resouce.


2. Write a blog objects and its internal reresentation in javascript:

     In javascript, an object is a standalone entity, with proerties and tye. 
Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup 
has a color, design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The sameway, Javascript 
objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
